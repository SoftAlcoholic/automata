API that generates a Wordpress page using the OpenAI GPT-3 language model.
OpenAI Wordpress Content Generator
This is a Python project that generates content for Wordpress pages using the OpenAI API. Specifically, it generates a title, an introduction, three key points, and some conclusions based on a given input text.

Requirements
To run this project, you will need:

Python 3.7 or higher
An OpenAI API key
A FastAPI installation
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required packages with pip install -r requirements.txt.
Create a config.py file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key as follows:

OPENAI_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
Usage
To generate content, you can send a POST request to the /generate endpoint with a JSON payload containing the input text:


import requests

url = "http://localhost:8000/generate"

payload = {
    "text": "Your input text here"
}

response = requests.post(url, json=payload)
content = response.json()

print(content)
This will return a JSON object with the generated title, introduction, key points, and conclusions.

Customization
If you want to customize the generator parameters, you can edit the following variables in the main.py file:

redaction_type: The type of redaction for the Wordpress page (e.g. "news", "tutorial", "opinion", etc.).
audience: The target audience for the page (e.g. "beginners", "experts", "students", etc.).
industry: The industry related to the page topic (e.g. "technology", "finance", "healthcare", etc.).
language: The language for the generated content (e.g. "English", "Spanish", "French", etc.).
max_tokens: The maximum number of tokens to generate for each prompt.
temperature: The sampling temperature for the OpenAI API (higher values generate more diverse text).
